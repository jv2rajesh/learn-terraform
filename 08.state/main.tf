/* https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3 */

/* A backend defines where Terraform stores its state data files.

  Terraform uses persisted state data to keep track of the resources it manages. Most non-trivial Terraform configurations either integrate with Terraform Cloud or use a backend to store state remotely. This lets multiple people access the state data and work together on that collection of infrastructure resources.
